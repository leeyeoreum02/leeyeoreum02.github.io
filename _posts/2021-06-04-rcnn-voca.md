1. **plateau:** reach a state of little or no change after a time of activity or progress (p. 1, line 2). 
2. **low-level image features:** image characteristics that are captured by computers for the purpose of recognition and classification (such as pixel intensity, pixel gradient orientation, color).
3. [**pixel intensity**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/pixel-intensity#:~:text=Since)
4. [**pixel gradient orientation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient#:~:text=Each)
5. **[high-level context](http://www.miningminds.re.kr/high-level-context-awareness/)**
6. **scalable:** object class 갯수가 수천개로 늘어나도 정확도 및 판단 속도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않는
